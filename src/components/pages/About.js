        <p>
          As a long-time member of the IT industry I have sought to learn more about web development to add to my
          arsenal of tools that continue to propel me into further project and challenges. I am currently an IT Manager, 
          heavy on the IT light on the manager; I push my team by being technically knowledgable. Managing people and 
          technologies is only one facet of what a successful IT Manager does in my opinion.

          I am about to graduate from a Web Development (Full Stack) Bootcamp through Michigan State University. I am planning
          to utilize my new coding skills to improve my employers online presence through a normal website and we have working
          plans on multiple portal projects which require stron front/back end skills for the entire Full Stack programming scheme.
